# Math Church

This is a just-for-fun mathutainment project using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) (of [3b1b](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) fame) as a graphics engine.

One goal is for all deliverables (lessens, math videos... sermons) be Python script text only. No ugly unpolishable binary turds. If there is a typo or a grammatical error or a _logical_ error, submit a pull request or an issue! (that's the idea).

Join [the discord server](https://discord.gg/XTHcHc7N) and ask the friendly folks you meet there about how to contribute (plain old hanging out is encouraged also.)

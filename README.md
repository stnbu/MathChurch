# Math Church

This is a just-for-fun mathutainment project using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) (of [3b1b](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) fame) as a graphics engine.

One goal is for all deliverables (lessens, math videos... sermons) to be Python scripts (text) only; no ugly unpolishable binary turds. If there is a typo or a grammatical error or a _logical_ error, submit a pull request or an issue! (that's the idea).

Join [the discord server](https://discord.gg/XTHcHc7N) and ask the friendly folks you meet there about how to contribute (plain old hanging out is encouraged also.)

# State-of-the-Church

You can run

```
python play/presenter.py
```

After satisfying all prerequisites.

Hints:

* Signing up for Google Text-to-Speech is a pain in the ass. Good luck!
* Other than that, manim is probably the most challenging thing. See their [excellent docs](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable).
* Holler. Submit an issue. Open a PR. and/or [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/XTHcHc7N).
